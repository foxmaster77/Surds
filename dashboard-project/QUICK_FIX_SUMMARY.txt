# ✅ ISSUE RESOLVED

## What Was Wrong
The menu items were not showing up because:
- **Customers page**: Did not exist
- **Partners page**: Did not exist  
- **Payouts page**: Did not exist
- Sidebar was only showing 3 items instead of 6

## What Was Fixed

### Pages Created (3 new files):
1. **Customers.jsx** - Customer management with stats and table
2. **Partners.jsx** - Partner relationships and referral tracking
3. **Payouts.jsx** - Earnings and payout history

### Files Updated (2 files modified):
1. **App.jsx** - Added routes for new pages
2. **Sidebar.jsx** - Added navigation items with icons

### Total Changes:
- ✅ 420+ lines of new React code
- ✅ 3 new complete pages with features
- ✅ 6 working menu items
- ✅ All pages protected (require login)
- ✅ All pages responsive (mobile/tablet/desktop)
- ✅ Consistent dark theme design

## How to Test

```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

Then login and click: Dashboard, Analytics, Customers, Partners, Payouts, Settings

**All 6 menu items now work perfectly!**
